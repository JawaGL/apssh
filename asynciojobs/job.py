# my first inclination had been to specialize asyncio.Task
# it does not work well though, because you want to model
# dependencies **before** anything starts, of course
# but in asyncio, creating a Task object implies scheduling that for execution

# so, let's have it the other way around
# what we need is a way to attach our own Job instances to the Task (and back)
# classes right after Task creation, so that
# (*) once asyncio.wait is done, we can easily find out wich Jobs are done or pending
# (*) from one Job, easily know what its status is by lloing into its Task obj
#     (if already started)

# Engine == graph
# Job == node

    (*) it offers some very basic graph-related features to model requirements
        a la makefile
    (*) its subclasses are expected to implement a `co_run()` method 
        that specifies the actual behaviour as a coroutine

    Can be created with 
    (*) boolean flag 'forever', if set, means the job is not returning at all and runs forever
        in this case Engine.orchestrate will not wait for that job, and will terminate it once all
        the regular i.e. not-forever jobs are done
    (*) an optional label - for convenience only

    It's mostly a companion class to the Engine class, that does the heavy lifting
